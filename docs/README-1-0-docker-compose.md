# Docker Compose
 - docker-compose (or kind where applicable) to create local/extra environments to run a full app including the service-owned persistence.Service dependencies can be mocked w/ ad-hoc compose service or be delegated to other environment service if read-only (eg. FSP or FDF).

## Ideas

 - Simple api project that use sql server
 - Unit tests using in memory db
 - integrations test using docker compose
 - Performance/Load tests? using docker compose?
 - Profiling memory using docker compose?

## Roadmap

 - DOCKER
   - docker sqlserver 
   - run docker
   - mount volume
   - connect via sql management studio
   - create friends database db/table etc...
   - stop/rerun/destroy/recreate docker
     - I want to understand how reuse a database as "template"
 
 - API
   - create an hello world api
   - create a database/table friends
   - create a hello controller 
     - create a GET /hello/{id} that produce {"response" : "hello $firstname"}
   - unit test/in memory database is out of scope (nice to have)
 - create an integration test project (nunit)
   - use in the test the docker instance
 
 - PIPELINES
   - investigate docker/docker compose steps
